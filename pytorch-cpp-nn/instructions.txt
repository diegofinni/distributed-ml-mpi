cInstructions on how to run the neural net (runs on random generated data)

delete the build folder

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=absolute/path/to/libtorch ..

(for me it was 
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/Users/nathanan/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com\~apple\~CloudDocs/Downloads/libtorch ..
)

this was will make you the makeFile

make
./train
